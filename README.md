# HonoursProjectApp
This is my repository for my honours project app.

This app is an Android food ordering app which wil allow customers to order food to their tables and for collection. 

Inside the folder "App" is the main application which customers will use, and the folder "ReceiverApp" will contain the app which the restaurant will use to receive customers requested orders and print them.

This project makes use of Firebase which is connected to a google sheets file for all the food items. 
Here, the restaurant owner can update the food items, descriptions and prices which will be updated in real-time to the app.
The firebase database will also store all of the registered users and allow them to make and process orders.
